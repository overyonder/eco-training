# Habitat Window

Update these bounds as you add each species. Valid ecosystem requires all ranges to overlap.

| Dimension | Min | Max | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| Depth (m) | | | |
| Temp (°C) | | | |
| Salinity (ppt) | | | |
| Current (cfs) | | | |

# Selected Species (8 slots)

| # | Species Name | Type | Provides | Needs | Eats |
|---|--------------|------|----------|-------|------|
| 1 | | Producer | | — | |
| 2 | | Producer | | — | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |

# Calorie Totals

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Provided** (sum of provided x population) | |
| **Total Needed** (consumers only: needed x population) | |
| **Ratio** (target >= 1.5) | |

# Food Chain Verification

For each consumer, confirm at least one food source is selected:

- [ ] Species 3 eats: _____________ (in selection? Y/N)
- [ ] Species 4 eats: _____________ (in selection? Y/N)
- [ ] Species 5 eats: _____________ (in selection? Y/N)
- [ ] Species 6 eats: _____________ (in selection? Y/N)
- [ ] Species 7 eats: _____________ (in selection? Y/N)
- [ ] Species 8 eats: _____________ (in selection? Y/N)

# Final Habitat Selection

Pick values near the **middle** of each range:

| Dimension | Your Value |
|-----------|------------|
| Depth | m |
| Temperature | °C |
| Salinity | ppt |
| Current | cfs |

# Quick Reference

**Three questions for each species (in order):**

1. Does it fit the habitat window?
2. Can it eat something already selected?
3. Does it narrow the window too much?

**Common mistakes:**

- Picking apex predator first (narrow ranges)
- Adding carnivore before its prey
- Forgetting to update habitat window
- Not tracking calorie totals
